		<p>Q = Do you work different body parts on different days?
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>A = Yes, I rotate between Chest and Tris, Back and Bis, Shoulders, and Glutes and Legs.  I usually work my abdominals in some way daily, as they recover faster than the other major muscles groups.  You want to give the groups a day or two to rest and recover in between workouts.</p>
		<p>Q = Do I need supplements?
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>A = Absolutely NOT!  You can get all your nutrients needed from food.  I utilize supplements with the busy lifestlye I have.  If I know I won't be able to get enough greens or protein in my day, I'll utilize supplements to meet my daily cap.</p>
		<p>Q = I am a female, will lifting weights make me look manly?
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>A = No! Hitting the weightroom will not make you look manly, and can actually help aid you in your weightloss journey.</p>
		<p>Q = Do you have cheat days or meals?
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>A = First, I LOVE FOOD! Yes, I will give myself cheat meals throughout the week.  When following diets for long periods of time, your body can eventually platuea. I like to give myself cheat meals to keep my body in check.  No, this doesn't mean I give myself a cheat meal daily.  I usually do it for a meal on the weekends, and meal prep for the rest of the week.
