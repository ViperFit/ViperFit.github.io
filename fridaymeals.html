		<b><p>BREAKFAST</b>
		<br>
		<br>Ingredients: 5 Slices of a Baguette, 2 Eggs, 2 Slices of Bacon, 2 Tbs Shredded Cheese, 1 Orange, 1 Tsp Butter, 1/4 Tsp Salt, 1/4 Tsp Pepper
		<br>
		<br>Directions: 1. Cook the bacon in the oven at 410 degrees F for 10-12 mins, depending on your desired crispness. Once done, remove the bacon from the oven and set aside to cool for a later step. 2. Whisk the eggs in a bowl with salt and pepper. 3. Melt the butter in a frying pan, ensuring to coat the sides. 4. Place your eggs in the pan and spread them out with your spatula, ensuring they get cooked through. 5. While your eggs are cooking, go ahead and toast your bread. This can be done via the oven broiler if you so choose. Just keep an eye on them, as they can toast quickly. 6. Crumble the bacon and add it along with the shredded cheese to your eggs and fold into an omelet. 7. Peel and separate your orange slices. 8. Plate your omelet, toasted baguette slices, and orange slices. Not a fan of the toasted baguettes or oranges? Go ahead and switch it up. This can also be made into an egg white omelet if you so choose, just separate the yolks in step and toss them away in step 2.</p>

		<b><p>LUNCH</b>
		<br>
		<br>Ingredients: Romaine, 1/4 Cup Red Onion, 1 Tomato, 1/4 Shredded Cheese, 3 Tbs Salsa, 1 Tbs Sour Cream, 4 oz Sirloin, 1/4 Tsp Salt, 1/4 Tsp Pepper, 1/4 Tsp Garlic
		<br>
		<br>Directions: 1. Clean and season the sirloin with salt, pepper, and garlic. Wrap in plastic wrap and set aside to get to room temperature before grilling. 2. Clean the romaine, tomato, red onion. Chope the lettuce and dice both the red onion and the tomato. 3. Grill the steak to your desired doneness. I like my steaks medium rare, but you can choose your preference. 4. Once the steaks is done cooking, take it off the grill and allow it to set for about 10 minutes before slicing into it. 5. Start to plate your dish. Adding the romaine, red onion, tomatoes, and shredded cheese. 6. Slice the sirloin into thin strips and place on top of your salad. 7. Finally, add your salsa and sour cream and enjoy. This is one of my favorite keto recipe go-to's when I am following that diet. It's super easy and quick! Want to mix it up?  Try adding grilled chicken or shrimp as a variation to this recipe.</p>
