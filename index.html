		<h2>Are You Ready To Get Fit?</h2>
		<p>Hi Everyone! I'm Jessica Brandon, a Fitness Enthusiast and I would love to help you reach your goals. Follow me, on my 6 week journey! I will be listing my diet, exercises, and supplements utilized for your convenience. I'm looking forward to embarking on this journey with you.</p>

		<p>I got started on my fitness journey shortly after my divorce.  I needed something to relieve the stress and anxiety I was feeling. Fitness truly gave me that escape I needed. I have completed my associate degree in Hotel, Restaurant, and Fitness Management.  I have also received my Instructor certifications in Boot Camp, Speed-Agility-Quickness (SAQ), and Core and Functional Fitness. I am also currently working on my NFPT Personal Trainers certification.</p>

		<p>As a single mother, full-time worker, and student life can get pretty hectic. I actually have my boys workout with me, and they get excited to do so... sometimes they even ask me to workout randomly! I love this because they keep me accountable and motivated.  I also started creating kid-friendly workouts for them to do while I am hitting the weights. #NOEXCUSES
