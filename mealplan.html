		<br>For this coding: I wanted to display basic content on the page itself, but also add links to daily content for meals and recipes. The links for both navigation through my site, and to my daily recipes are located within this HTML, but are colored and border through the CSS. I didn't want something too flashy, so I chose hot pink for the text and a dotted aqua for the border. I also utilized the CSS to add borders, text colors, link colors, etc to the whole page. I utilized this HTML to separate the two images on the left and right, and utilized the CSS to border them in aqua. For this page I did not want it to overlap any paragraphs, so I utilized line breaks to separate the content.</p>

		<h2>Weekly Meals</h2>
		<p><br>Diet is about 80% of your fitness journey.  If you aren't eating right, you won't see the results you are trying to achieve. For me, cooking is another passion. Most of the time I will get creative in the kitchen and make new recipes from scratch. My goal is to one day create a cookbook for my family and friends to utilize.

		<p><br>A good practive to get into the habit of is meal prepping for the week.  I usually plan my meals out on Saturday for the week, and on Sunday afternoon get to cooking. This again, helps with the busy lifestyle I have.  The only meal I usually don't prep for is breakfast.
		<br>
		<br>Don't forget the desserts!! This banana pudding with sugarfree pudding, homemade whipped cream, and toasted coconuts is a favorite of mine!
