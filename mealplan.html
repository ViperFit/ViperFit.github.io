		<h2>Weekly Meals</h2>
		<p><br>Diet is about 80% of your fitness journey.  If you aren't eating right, you won't see the results you are trying to achieve. For me, cooking is another passion. Most of the time I will get creative in the kitchen and make new recipes from scratch. My goal is to one day create a cookbook for my family and friends to utilize.

		<p><br>A good practive to get into the habit of is meal prepping for the week.  I usually plan my meals out on Saturday for the week, and on Sunday afternoon get to cooking. This again, helps with the busy lifestyle I have.  The only meal I usually don't prep for is breakfast.
		<br>
		<br>Don't forget the desserts!! This banana pudding with sugarfree pudding, homemade whipped cream, and toasted coconuts is a favorite of mine!
