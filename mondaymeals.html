		<b><p>BREAKFAST</b>
		<br>
		<br>Ingredients: 4 Eggs, 1 Lemon, Tsp Salt, Tsp Cayenne Pepper, 1/4 Cup Butter, 1 English Muffin, Romaine Lettuce, 1 Tomato, 2 Slices Bacon, 2 Tbs Apple Cider Vinegar
		<br>
		<br>Directions: 1. Bring to a boil, 2 cups of water and apple cider vinegar. 2. Cook bacon in the oven, 410 degrees F for 10-15 mins (depending on your desired crispness).  3. Crack one egg into a bowl and stir the boiling water/vinegar mix. As the water is rotating in a circular motion drop your egg in and continue to swirl the water with your spoon gently to ensure you don't break the yolk. Cook the egg for about 3 minutes. 4. While the egg is cooking, toast your english muffin. 5. Once toasted dress each half of the muffin with lettuce, a slice of tomato, and 1 slice of bacon. 6. Take your cooked egg out, and gently set it on top of one of the muffin sides. Repeat step 3 with the other egg, and place it on top of the other slice once done. 7. Separate the two yolks from the last two eggs and toss the egg whites as we won't need them. 8. Mix 1/4 lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and salt to the yolks. 9. Melt the butter. Once done stir the butter into the yolk mix. Once blended well, heat the mixture in the		 			microwave for 15-20 seconds and stir well again. 10. Last, drizzle the designed amount of hollandaise sauce on top of your Eggs Benedict. Garnish with salt, pepper, and green onions.</p>
