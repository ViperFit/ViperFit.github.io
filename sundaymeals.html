		<br>For this coding: I wanted to display my meals as well as provide detailed recipes my users can utilize at home. Even though this is a branch off of the Meal Plan page, I still wanted to provide the navigation links to not only the top of the page, but also the other menu days. I decided to keep Meal, Ingredients, and Recipe into one paragraph instead of separating them, and utilized line breaks in between the content or to start a new line. I utilized the HTML instead of the CSS to adjust my pictures to either the left, right, or center of the page. I utilized the CSS to add borders, text colors, link colors, etc.</p>
