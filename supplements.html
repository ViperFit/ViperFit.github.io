		<p>I absolutely love Vade's protein powder.  I have yet to find one that even compares to the smoothness of it.  There's absolutely nothing I hate more than gritty protein powder. Vade even went above and beyond to create single serve packs of protein powder in an edible food-grade film. Try out Vade's Dissolvable Protein Scoops! Perfect for those always on the go! Plus, they're a Keto friendly product!</p>
