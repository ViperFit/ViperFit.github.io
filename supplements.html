		<br>
		<p>I am a Brand Ambassador for Alpha Elite.  This is a Veteran owned business, and every purchase goes into supporting the Green Beret Foundation. I personally love their Sugar Skull Pre-Workout, and Metal Detox drink. I consume the detox drink prior to bed, as it helps with reducing my anxities and relaxes my body.  Use my code BRANDON15 for 15% off your order at Alpha Elite!</p>

		<br>
		<p>Barbells and Ponytails are one of my favorite women's gym apparel sites.  This woman owned business was created when the owner fell in love with CrossFit, and didn't like what she saw when shopping for new gear. They design their apparel for women who specifically like to lift weights, and want to feel strong and confident. This brand is designed for women of any shape, and size. Military and 1st Responders receive a 20% discount.</p>

		<br>
		<p>I absolutely love Vade's protein powder, and I have yet to find one that even compares to the smoothness of it.  There's absolutely nothing I hate more than gritty protein powder. Vade went above and beyond to create single serve packs of protein powder in an edible food-grade film. This is the perfect solution for those always on the go!</p>
