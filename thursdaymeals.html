		<b><p>BREAKFAST</b>
		<br>
		<br>Ingredients: 2 Slice of Bread, 2 Egg Whites, 2 Slices of Bacon, 1 Slice of American Cheese, 1 Honeycrisp Apple, 1 Tsp Butter
		<br>
		<br>Directions: 1. Cook the bacon in the oven at 410 degrees F for 10-12 mins, depending on your desired crispness. Once done, remove from the oven and set aside for a later step. 2. Separate the eggs whites into a bowl, and toss the yolks away. 3. Melt the butter in a frying pan, ensuring to coat the sides. 4. Place your egg whites in the pan and spread them out with your spatula, ensuring they get cooked through. 5. While your eggs are cooking, go ahead and toast your bread. 6. Add the sliced cheese to your eggs and fold into a square, about the size of your bread. 7. Construct your sandwhich with your toast, cheesy eggs, and bacon. 8. Make an apple garnish. To do so slice one side of the apple. Lay the flat side down onto a cutting board, and make thing slices. Ensure you keep the slices together while cutting. 9. Stick a toothpick into one side of all the slices, and fan out. Cut a cube out of the remaining apple to act as your base, sticking the exposed toothpick into the cube. This will support your 				fanned apple. </p>
