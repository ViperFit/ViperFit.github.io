		<b><p>BREAKFAST</b>
		<br>
		<br>Ingredients: 2 Slices Of Bacon, 3 Eggs, 1 Piece of Bread, 1/4 Onion, 4 Mushrooms, 1 tomato, 2 Tbs Butter, 1/4 Cup Shredded Cheese, 1 Tsp salt, 1 Tsp pepper
		<br>
		<br>Directions: 1. Place bacon into oven at 410 degrees F for 10-12 mins, time can vary depending on your desired crispness. 2. Wash and dice mushrooms, tomato, and onion. 3. Melt 1 Tbs butter in a pan and sautee mushrooms and onions. Once cooked to your liking, remove from heat and set aside. 4. Pull bacon out of the oven and set aside. 5. Whisk the eggs into a bowl, and add salt and pepper to season. 6. Melt the last of the butter into a frying pan, ensuring to coat the sides as well. 7. Pour your egg mixture into the pan. Spread it around with your spatula ensuring it is cooked through. 8. Sprinkle your cheese, mushrooms, onions, and 1/2 of your tomatoes onto the eggs and allow the cheese to melt. 9. Toast your bread. Once done, place onto a plate with bacon. 10. Fold your omelet in half, and carefully place onto the plate. Finally, garnish with the remaining tomatoes. Keep in mind, there are several different ingredients you can place inside an omelet so don't be afraid to get creative.</p>

		<b><p>LUNCH</b>
		<br>
		<br>Ingredients: 1 Potato, 2 Tbs Sour Cream, 1 Tbs Butter, 1 Tbs Chives, 2 Pieces of Bacon, 1/4 Cup Shredded Cheese, 2 Tbs BBQ Sauce, 1 Tsp salt, 1 Tsp Pepper, Leftover Protein (For This Recipe I Used Pulled Pork)
		<br>
		<br>Directions: 1. Clean potato and stab with a fork or knive to allow venting during the cooking process. 2. Completely cover the potato with tin foil, place in oven at 450 degrees F, and baked for 25-30 mins. 3. Cooked bacon in a pan to your desired doneness. Once cooked through set aside for later. 4. Chop up the chives, and set aside. 5. Place the sour cream and BBQ sauce into separate zip lock bags. 6. Pull the potato from the over and allow to cool for a moment. 7. Reheat your leftover protein and set aside. 8. Place the potato onto your place. Add your butter and cheese to melt, and season with salt and pepper. 9. Next start assembling the toppings, place the leftover protein and bacon on first. 10. Cut one of the corners of the ziploc baggie and drizzle the sour cream and bbq sauce on top of your potato. 11. Finally, top the potato with the chives. As with the omelet, baked potatoes can be made with numberous toppings.  This is one of my favorite meals to go to when I have leftovers to utilize.</p>

		<b><p>DINNER</b>

Please note that you can use the microwaveable rice as well. 3. Clean and snip the ends of the asparagus off. Toss the asparagus in olive oil, salt and pepper and place onto a baking sheet. 4. Place your salmon on the grill to cook, skin side down. A Cedar Plank can also be utilized in the grilling process if you so choose. 5. Place your asparagus into the oven to roast at 375 degrees for 15-20 mins, depending on your desired doneness. 6. While your salmon and asparagus are cooking whip up a sauce for your salmon. Mix the soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes together. Heat in the microwave for 10-15 seconds, to help evaportate the sugar crystals. 7. Slice your lemon for garnishing your salmon. 8. Start to assemble your plate. Add your rice, salmon, and aspargus. Place the lemon onto your salmon, drizzle your   			sauce onto the salmon, and sprinkle parsley onto the rice.</p>
