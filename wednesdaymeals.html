		<b><p>BREAKFAST</b>
		<br>
		<br>Ingredients: 3 Egg Whites, 1/4  Cup Feta, 1 Cup Red Kale, 1 Tbs Butter, 2 Sausage Patties, 1/4 Tsp Salt, 1/4 Tsp Pepper, 1/4 Tsp Garlic
		<br>
		<br>Directions: 1. Separate your egg whites, and toss the yolks away. 2. Whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside.  2. Wash and separate the kale leaves from the stalks. 3. Cook your sausage patties in the over at 350 degrees F, for 12-15 mins. 4. Melt 1/2 of your butter into a pan. Toss your kale in to sautee, and season with salt, pepper, and garlic. Once done, remove from the heat and set aside. 5. Melt the remaining butter into a frying pan, ensuring to coat the edges. 6. Pour in your egg whites, and spread them out in the pan with a spatula to ensure every bit is cooked. 7. Next, add you feta and kale to your egg whites. Allow the feta to melt somewhat and begin to fold. 8. Place the omelete onto your plate and add your 2 sausage patties from the oven and enjoy. Keep in mind, there are several different ingredients you can place inside an omelet so don't be afraid to get creative. You can also switch up your protein you serve this omelet with, and add fresh fruit to garnish.  		</p>

		<b><p>LUNCH</b>
		<br>
		<br>Ingredients: Ground Turkey, 1/2 Cup Cherry Tomatoes, 1 Kiwi, 1/2 Cup Vanilla Greek Yogurt, 1/4 Cup Fresh Mozzarella, 1/2 Tsp Salt, 1/4 Tsp Pepper, 1/4 Tsp Garlic, 1/4 Italian Seasonings, 1 Tbs Soy Sauce, 1 Tbs Balsalmic Vinegar 
		<br>
		<br>Directions: 1. Brown the ground turkey in a frying pan, and drain of any grease. Season the meat with salt, pepper, garlic, and soy sauce. Stir in the seasonings, and set aside for later. 2. Clean, peel, and slice the kiwi. Once done, set them aside. 3. Clean the tomatoes. You can choose to cut them in half or leave them whole. That is entirely up to your preference. 4. Slice the mozzarella into thin slices for your caprese salad. 5. Next, start to asemble your dish. I utilize a meal prep bowl, since there are a lot of different flavor combinations going on here.  Add your ground turkey into one compartment.  Next, scoop up your yogurt into another and garnish with your kiwi. Finally, assemble your caprese salad using the tomatoes and mozzarella as the basis. Sprinkling the Italian seasonings on top and drizzle with the balsamic vinegar. Not a fan of kiwi?  Mix up the fruit and yogurt combination. Also, ground turkey is great for meal prepping throughout the week. It's cheap, cooks fast, and tastes      		great!</p>
